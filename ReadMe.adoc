= IoT-enabled Air Quality Monitoring and Weather Comparison System =
Project Completion on 04/15/2024
== Overview ==
This project focuses on the development of an IoT-enabled Air Quality Monitoring and Weather Comparison System using ESP8266 and Arduino Cloud. The system integrates various sensors, such as DHT11 (for temperature and humidity) and MQ-135 (for air quality assessment), to collect real-time environmental data. Through Arduino Cloud, this data is stored, visualized, and made accessible via a cloud-based dashboard. Additionally, weather API integration enables users to compare indoor conditions with external meteorological data.

== Features ==

Real-time environmental monitoring using ESP8266 and sensors

Cloud-based visualization through Arduino Cloud dashboard

Weather API integration for comparative analysis

User-friendly interface displaying air quality index, temperature, and humidity

Historical data tracking for trend analysis

== Components ==
Hardware:

ESP8266 Microcontroller - for data processing and cloud communication

DHT11 Sensor - measures temperature and humidity

MQ-135 Sensor - detects air pollutants like CO2 and VOCs

WiFi Module - for cloud connectivity

Software:

Arduino Cloud - for data storage, retrieval, and visualization

OpenWeatherMap API - for external weather data integration

Flask Web Application - for additional analytics and visualization

== System Architecture ==

Sensors collect real-time air quality and weather data.

ESP8266 processes and transmits data to Arduino Cloud.

Arduino Cloud dashboard visualizes temperature, humidity, and air quality.

External weather data is fetched via API for comparison.

Data is displayed interactively for user insights.

== Setup Instructions ==

Hardware Setup:

Connect DHT11 and MQ-135 sensors to ESP8266 as per circuit diagram.

Ensure WiFi connectivity for ESP8266.

2. API Data Integration ChallengesProblem: Issues retrieving and displaying external weather data.Solution: Implemented caching mechanisms and optimized API request handling.

== Future Enhancements ==

Addition of more advanced sensors for pollutants like PM2.5 and NO2.

Integration with machine learning models for predictive analytics.

Mobile app for remote monitoring and notifications.

Public dashboard access for broader environmental insights.

== Conclusion ==
This IoT project demonstrates the effective combination of sensor networks, cloud computing, and data visualization for environmental monitoring. The system provides a real-time, user-friendly platform for individuals and researchers to assess and compare air quality with external weather conditions, contributing to informed decision-making and improved environmental awareness.
